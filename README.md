### Starter Application for Node JS
To get started clone the project to a local folder and make any desired changes.

To run a local server run `gulp` from your terminal.

To run a production server run `npm start` from your terminal.

If deploying to Heroku, tell Heroku to run `npm start` & create a post install script that runs `gulp dist`.
